## 👩‍💻 My Contribution & Findings
This project was developed as part of my learning in **AI and Python automation**. I designed the **speech recognition logic**, implemented **text-to-speech output**, and structured the **main command flow**.
Through this project, I learned how to connect different Python libraries to create a voice-controlled AI system. I also understood how speech-to-text and text-to-speech engines work, how commands can be executed using system functions, and how AI can make desktop automation more interactive and intelligent.
